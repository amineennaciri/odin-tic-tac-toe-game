# odin-tic-tac-toe-game
This is the tic tac toe from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a tic tac toe game app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around JavaScript.

Self-reflection and conclusion: 

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice clean coding using objects and constructors.
I was able to group all my global variables and functions inside my object as properties or methods.
Secondly, I was able to simplify lines of code using constructors that enable to create multiple objects in demand.
Next time I come back to this project I will try creating an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
Starting by just getting the computer to make a random legal move.
Then, I will try to increase the intelligence of the computer using an algorithm.
